 - The potential is the ROSETTA bounded potential explained here:

 - Force constant simpy multiplies the potential by a scaling factor.

 - Seamless restraint switching adds a bias, which connects potential surfaces when switching from one set of restraints to another. This effectively forces switching of restraints.
